    Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the todo.py file is located.
    Run the script by typing python3 todo.py and pressing Enter.
    Use the arrow keys to navigate through the tasks or choose an option from the menu by typing its number.
    To add a new task, choose option 1 and enter the task text when prompted.
    To mark a task as done, choose option 2 and select the task by using the arrow keys.

Example

Here's an example of how the script might look when running:

less

To-Do List:
0. [ ] Buy groceries
1. [ ] Walk the dog
2. [ ] Pay bills

What do you want to do?
1. Add a task
2. Mark a task as done
3. Quit
>> 2

To-Do List:
0. [ ] Buy groceries
1. [x] Walk the dog
2. [ ] Pay bills

What do you want to do?
1. Add a task
2. Mark a task as done
3. Quit
>> 3

In this example, the user selected option 2 to mark a task as done, and then selected the second task ("Walk the dog") using the arrow keys. The script then updated the to-do list to show the task as completed. Finally, the user selected option 3 to quit the script.
